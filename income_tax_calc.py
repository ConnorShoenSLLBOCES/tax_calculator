Title: Income Tax Calculator
Author: Connor Shoen

Psudo-Code: Code-like structure in plain english
1.) Input gross income and number of dependants

2.) Compute the taxable income using the formula:
Taxable income = gross income -10000 - (300 / number of dependents)

3.) Compute income tax using the formula:
Tax = taxable income * 0.20

4.) Print the total tax
"""

"""
Better Psudo-Code:

Compute a persons income tax.
1.) Significant constants (Non-changing variables):
    tax_rate
    standard_deduction
    deduction_per_dependant

2.) The Imputs are:
    gross_incoome
    number_of_dependents

3.) Computations:
    Taxable income = standard deduction - a deduction for each dependant
    Income tax = a fixed percentage of your taxable income

4.) The outputs:
    Your income tax
